# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game - C++

## 📌 Project Description
This is a console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented in C++.  
Players compete against the computer, and the game tracks the results of each round, including wins, losses, and draws.  
The program provides a simple interactive menu, rounds selection, and colorful console feedback.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++  
- Standard C++ libraries: `<iostream>`, `<cstdlib>`, `<windows.h>`  

## 🚀 Features
